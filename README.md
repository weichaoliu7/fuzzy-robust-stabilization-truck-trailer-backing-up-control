# fuzzy-robust-stabilization-truck-trailer-backing-up-control
[1] develop a control system for backing up a computer simulated truck-trailer which is nonlinear and unstable. By approximating the truck-trailer by a fuzzy system with premise parameter uncertainty, we design a fuzzy controller which guarantees stability of the control system under a condition.
